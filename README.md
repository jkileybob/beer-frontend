BEER DIARY

Beer Diary is an application meant to record different beers a user would like to rememeber. By implementing 3rd party APIs such as the Open Brewery DB API and the GoogleMaps API, a user can search for a brewery by name, city, or state, and log a new beer entry with full CRUD capability. Custom authentication using JWT and bcrypt (on the backend) keeps user passwords secure on login and throughout a user session. 

Styled with Semantic UI and custom CSS.


Cheers!
